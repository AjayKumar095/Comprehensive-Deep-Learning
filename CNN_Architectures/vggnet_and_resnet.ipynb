    "1. VGGNet: VGGNet, developed by the Visual Geometry Group at Oxford, is characterized by its simplicity and depth. It consists of a series of convolutional layers with 3x3 filters, where each layer doubles the number of feature channels as the network deepens. The design relies on very small (3x3) convolutional filters, with multiple layers stacked together, followed by pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions. VGGNet has multiple variants, with VGG-16 and VGG-19 being the most popular, containing 16 and 19 weight layers, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ResNet: ResNet (Residual Network) introduced residual connections (or skip connections) to combat the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks. These connections allow the network to learn an “identity mapping” by skipping one or more layers and adding the output of a previous layer directly to a later one. This approach makes it possible to train extremely deep networks, such as ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and even deeper variants, with layers numbering in the hundreds."

    "neural networks.</h3>\n",
    "The motivation for residual connections in ResNet was to address the vanishing gradient problem commonly encountered in very deep networks. As networks become deeper, the gradients used in backpropagation tend to diminish, causing layers close to the input to learn slowly or not at all. Residual connections help mitigate this issue by allowing gradients to flow more directly through the network during backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual connections also enable the network to learn residual mappings (i.e., the difference between the input and output of a layer) rather than learning the full transformation. This simplifies the optimization process, allowing the model to scale to hundreds of layers without suffering from degradation in performance. As a result, ResNet achieves significantly better accuracy in deep architectures, with reduced training time and improved convergence."

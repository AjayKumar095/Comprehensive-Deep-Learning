    "<h3>Q1.Explain the architecture of LeNet-5 and its significance in the field of deep learning.</h3>\n",
    "LeNet-5, developed by Yann LeCun and his colleagues in 1998, is one of the earliest convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and laid the groundwork for deep learning models in image recognition tasks. Initially designed for handwritten digit recognition in the MNIST dataset, LeNet-5 consists of a series of convolutional and pooling layers that capture spatial hierarchies of features in images. This architecture's success in image processing marked a significant step forward in using neural networks to solve practical visual recognition problems, setting the stage for more advanced architectures in the years to come."

    "\n",
    "LeNet-5's architecture comprises seven layers (not counting the input layer), each performing a specific function to process and extract features from an input image:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input Layer: Accepts a 32x32 grayscale image, usually resized from 28x28 for MNIST data.\n",
    "- Convolutional Layer 1 (C1): Applies six convolutional filters of size 5x5, resulting in six 28x28 feature maps. This layer extracts low-level features, such as edges and textures.\n",
    "- Subsampling Layer 1 (S2): A pooling layer that reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps to 14x14. This layer uses average pooling to achieve translation invariance, downsampling the data while retaining key features.\n",
    "- Convolutional Layer 2 (C3): Applies sixteen 5x5 convolutional filters, producing sixteen 10x10 feature maps. This layer captures more complex patterns and structures in the image.\n",
    "- Subsampling Layer 2 (S4): Another pooling layer that reduces the feature maps to 5x5, further downsampling and helping to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- Fully Connected Layer 1 (C5): A dense layer with 120 neurons that processes the flattened output from the previous layer, integrating features across the entire image.\n",
    "- Fully Connected Layer 2 (F6): Another dense layer with 84 neurons, further abstracting the features before the final classification.\n",
    "- Output Layer: A softmax layer with 10 units, each representing a digit class from 0 to 9, providing the final classification."

    "AlexNet, developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton, was designed to process high-resolution color images and consists of five convolutional layers, followed by three fully connected layers. Its key contributions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ReLU Activation: ReLU activation functions replaced sigmoid, which enabled faster training and helped mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "- Max Pooling: AlexNet used max pooling to downsample feature maps, which proved effective in retaining key features.\n",
    "- GPU Implementation: AlexNet's architecture was trained on multiple GPUs, significantly reducing training time and enabling processing of larger datasets.\n",
    "- Dropout Regularization: To prevent overfitting, AlexNet introduced dropout layers in the fully connected layers, a method that randomly disables certain neurons during training.\n",
    "- Use of Large Filters: AlexNet employed large convolutional filters, capturing more complex features from the input images."

    "<em>An activation function in Deep Learning (DL) is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron in a neural network to introduce non-linearity. This non-linearity is crucial because it allows the neural network to learn complex patterns and relationships in data, enabling it to solve more complicated tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and others.\n",

    "<p><b>Answer.</b></p>\n",
    "Activation functions in the hidden layers of a neural network are essential for enabling the network to learn complex patterns and perform well on non-linear tasks. Here’s a breakdown of their significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Activation functions add non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn and model complex patterns that a simple linear function cannot.\n",
    "- Without non-linear activation functions, the entire network would act as a single linear transformation, no matter how many layers it has. This would significantly limit the network's ability to capture intricate relationships in data.\n",
    "- Activation functions influence how gradients propagate back through the network during backpropagation, which is essential for updating weights.\n",
    "- Some activation functions, like ReLU, mitigate issues like the vanishing gradient problem, allowing gradients to flow more effectively, which is crucial in training deeper networks.\n",
    "- Certain activation functions, such as ReLU, output zero for negative values, which introduces sparsity into the network. Sparsity can act as a form of regularization, reducing overfitting by making the network focus on essential features rather than every input detail."

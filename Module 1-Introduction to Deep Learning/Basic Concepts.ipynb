    "1. Introduction\n",
    "Neural Networks (NNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of biological neurons. They consist of interconnected nodes, known as neurons or units, organized in layers: the input layer, hidden layers, and output layer.<br>\n",
    "Each neuron in the network processes inputs, applies a weight to each input, sums them up, passes this sum through an activation function, and then produces an output. Mathematically, the process for a single neuron can be expressed as:<br><br>\n",
    "z = (limit i = 1 up to n), ∑ w<sub>i</sub> . x<sub>i</sub> + b\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- x<sub>i</sub> represents the input features,\n",
    "- w<sub>i</sub> are the corresponding weights,\n",
    "- b is the bias term, and\n",
    "- z is the weighted sum.<br><br>\n",
    "This weighted sum is passed through an activation function σ(z), which introduces non-linearity into the network, allowing it to model complex relationships."

    "- 1943: Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts proposed the first model of a neural network, the McCulloch-Pitts Neuron.\n",
    "- 1958: Frank Rosenblatt introduced the Perceptron, an early type of neural network that could classify data.\n",
    "- 1969: Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert's book highlighted the limitations of perceptrons, leading to a decline in interest.\n",
    "- 1980s: The concept of backpropagation, introduced by Geoffrey Hinton and others, reignited interest in neural networks by making it feasible to train deep networks.\n",
    "- 2000s-Present: The advent of powerful GPUs, large datasets, and advances in algorithms (e.g., ReLU activation and Dropout) led to the era of Deep Learning."

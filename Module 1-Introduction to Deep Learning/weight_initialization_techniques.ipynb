    "\n",
    "The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients, or error signals, become extremely small during backpropagation in deep neural networks. This causes layers near the input of the network to receive little to no gradient, resulting in minimal updates to their weights. Consequently, the network struggles to learn, leading to slow convergence or stagnation in training."

    "<h3>Q2. Explain how Xavier initialization addresses the vanishing gradient problem?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Xavier initialization (also known as Glorot initialization) helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by setting the initial weights such that the variance of activations is preserved as they propagate forward and backward. In Xavier initialization, weights are scaled based on the number of neurons in the layer (either the previous layer or average of previous and next layers). This scaling keeps gradients and activations within a reasonable range, preventing them from becoming too small."

    "<h3>Q4.Define the exploding gradient problem in deep neural networks. How does it impact training?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploding gradient problem occurs when gradients become excessively large during backpropagation, often in very deep networks. This can lead to large updates to the weights, causing instability and divergence in the training process. It is particularly problematic for recurrent neural networks, where gradients accumulate over many timesteps."

    "\n",
    "Proper weight initialization is crucial for ensuring stable gradients and efficient learning in deep neural networks. By carefully initializing weights, we can prevent gradients from vanishing or exploding, allowing the network to learn more effectively. Good initialization strategies can help maintain the variance of activations and gradients across layers, improving convergence rates and stability."

    "<h3>Q6.Explain the concept of batch normalization and its impact on weight initialization techniques?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch normalization is a technique that normalizes the inputs of each layer to have a mean of zero and variance of one within each batch. This regularization reduces internal covariate shift, stabilizes training, and reduces dependence on weight initialization. Batch normalization allows for higher learning rates and can lessen the risk of vanishing or exploding gradients by maintaining a consistent distribution of layer outputs, leading to improved convergence."
